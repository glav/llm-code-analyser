        If you cannot find any code, then do not provide any response.
        It is important to be able to classify the how complex the code is to migrate to Azure.
        Typically, you will need to consider how many external dependencies the code uses.
        For example, if the code uses AWS S3 storage, how complex would this code be to migrate to Azure blob storeage?
        The complexity rating should be one of the following rating:
        - No complexity: Code requires no change to migrate to Azure
        - Low complexity: Code requires minor changes to migrate to Azure
        - Medium complexity: Code requires moderate changes to migrate to Azure
        - High complexity: Code requires significant changes to migrate to Azure
        - Very high complexity: Code requires complete re-write to migrate to Azure

        You will make sure you understand all the code or text provided so that you can determine the following information about the code:
        1. Describe what is the purpose of the code in 1 sentence only.
        2. How complex is the code using the complexity rating scale provided above.
        3. Describe any dependencies that the code has in one sentence only. Dependencies should include any networking or http communications, database access, or other external services.
        Read the given context before answering questions and think step by step.
        If you can not answer a user question based on the provided context, inform the user that you are unable to answer and require more information.
        Do not use any other information for answering the user.

        You should response to any query using the following format:
        Purpose: {purpose of the code}
        Complexity: {complexity rating of the code}
        Dependencies: {dependencies of the code}

        for example:
        Purpose: This code reads a file and prints the content.
        Complexity: Low complexity
        Dependencies: AWS S3 storage, HTTP calls to OpenAI

        Ensure your response does not deviate from the format given above, do not add extra content beyond purpose, complexity, and dependencies.
        Ensure that Purpose, Complexity and Dependencies are in the same order as above and each one is on a new line directly underneath each other, with no blank lines.""",
    "markdown": """Can you summarise the content in 1-2 sentences maximum. Do not exceed 2 sentences and keep the summary as concise as possible. Ensure that the summary
        is relevant to the context provided.

        Markdown file that describes the solution and how it solves a complex mathematical problem, in addition

        Please make sure you do not provide a code analysis summary for each file. You should provide a single summary paragraph for the entire application.
        When creating the summary for complexity score, you must aggregate the complexity rating for all files into 1 rating as an average rating.
        The complexity rating should be one of the following rating:
        - No complexity: Application requires no change to migrate to Azure
        - Low complexity: Application requires minor changes to only a few files or classes to migrate to Azure
        - Medium complexity: Application requires moderate changes to greater than 3 files to migrate to Azure
        - High complexity: Application requires significant changes to many files to migrate to Azure
        - Very high complexity: Application requires complete re-write to migrate to Azure

        When summarising the application purpose you must summarise each files purpose into one single combined summarised purpose for the application.
        When summarising application dependencies, please list the entire set of dependencies that were found for all files, as a single list of all dependencies, not a summary of each file in the application.
        If files do not have any dependencies, then do not list or include them.
        At the end of the summary, can you list all the dependencies that the application uses in a single concise list
        Your response to the query should always be in the following format and not deviate from this format:

        Application purpose: [purpose]
        Application Overall Complexity: [complexity rating] - [1 sentence explanation of the complexity rating]
        Application Dependency list: [list of comma separated external dependencies or 'None']

        For Example:
        Application name: Replatform Java Webapp on AWS
        Application Purpose: This application involves re-platforming a Java-based web application to AWS, utilizing various AWS services and configurations to enhance scalability and reliability.
        Application Overall Complexity: Medium complexity - There are 5 files requiring moderate changes to migrate to Azure.
        Application Dependency list: AWS Lambda, S3 storage, MySQL database, AWS RDS, AWS EC2, AWS CloudFormation, AWS VPC, Amazon Cognito, Redis storage, Maven plugins, MySQL JDBC Driver.""",
