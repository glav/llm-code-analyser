        If you cannot find any code, then do not provide any response.
                  You will make sure you understand all the code or text provided so that you can determine the following information about the code:
        1. Describe what is the purpose of the code in 1 sentence only.
        2. How complex is the code? You should score the complexity of the code on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being very low complexity and 10 being extremely complex.
        3. Describe any dependencies that the code has in one sentence only. Dependencies should include any networking or http communications, database access, or other external services.
        Read the given context before answering questions and think step by step.

        Purpose: {purpose of the code}
        Complexity: {complexity score of the code}
        Dependencies: {dependencies of the code}

        for example:
        Purpose: This code reads a file and prints the content.
        Complexity: 3
        Dependencies: AWS S3 storage, network calls to OpenAI

        Ensure your response does not deviate from the format given above, do not add extra content beyond purpose, complexity, and dependencies.
        Ensure that Purpose, Complexity and Dependencies are in the same order as above and each one is on a new line directly underneath each other, with no blank lines.""",

        Please make sure you do not provide a code analysis summary for each file. You should provide a single summary paragraph for the entire application.
        When creating the summary for complexity score, you must aggregate the complexity scores for all files into 1 score as an average score.
        When summarising the application purpose you must summarise each files purpose into one single combined summarised purpose for the application.
        When summarising application dependencies, please list the entire set of dependencies that were found for all files, as a single list of all dependencies, not a summary of each file in the application.
        If files do not have any dependencies, then do not list or include them.
        At the end of the summary, can you list all the dependencies that the application uses in a single concise list

        Application purpose: [purpose]
        Application Overall Complexity: [complexity score]
        Application Dependency list: [list of comma separated external dependencies or 'None']

        For Example:
        Application name: Replatform Java Webapp on AWS
        Application Purpose: This application involves re-platforming a Java-based web application to AWS, utilizing various AWS services and configurations to enhance scalability and reliability.
        Application Overall Complexity: 6 (out of 10)
